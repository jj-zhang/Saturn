# What is S@turn?
Saturn is an application that can be used to remember upcoming events and releases. Saturn is not a calendar, unlike a calendar which is *typically* sparsely populated with events, Saturn records your most important standout events like new product releases, concerts, television premiers, and sports tournaments. Better yet Saturn takes all the guess work out and rather than showing you empty cells for every day we only serve you elements for events you are attending or interested in simplifying and improving the user experience. 

# Business Oppurtunities
Saturn would be free to use with profit coming from partnerships. Companies could pay to show their events to more users and Saturn could implement deep links into online stores and streaming services.

# The Development Team
Saturn has been developed by six University of Toronto students for their Introduction to Software Engineering (CSC301) class.
